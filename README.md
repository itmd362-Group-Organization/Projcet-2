# Project-2 

It was fun working on this project and with Griselda Pasillas and Yelitza Castro. I learned how to use Github in the terminal much better with this project, like push and pull from the master. Setting our organization's URL as the upstream and setting origin to the forked repository allowed us to manage what got pushed to the project and what could be pulled when there were issues. in addition, I learned a lot with Professor Krieglstein with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I could use some more practice with Mobile CSS I had some trouble with it but eventually, I figured out how to resize everything and to fit on a mobile screen for all users. Final Note thank you Professor Krieglstein for teaching me how to design and implement websites, so I am comfortable enough to design sites for myself and the future.
